## Data Used
### Data you provide
-	Image containing people’s faces.

### Data calculated by app
-	Estimated age.
-	Estimated gender.

## Purpose of Data Collection
Data is collected to provide the primary service of analyzing the faces within an image and displaying the resulting information.
Without being given an image from the user, the app wouldn’t be able to function as intended.

## Who Can See Your Data
**Only the user of the app.**

The only person who can view the image and the facial information is the user of the app. The data the app collects is not stored or sent anywhere and remains within the app, locally. Additionally, once the app is closed, the data is not stored and is only available while the app is open.

## Your Privacy Rights
You have the ability to revoke the app’s camera permission from your device’s Settings. Once this done, the app will not have accees to the camera or photo gallery. 
However, it is important to note that doing so will prevent it from serving its purpose of providing facial information from images.
